# Toki

## 🚀 Overview

This project marks my first significant step as a software engineering student breaking free from tutorial hell by actually building practical, full-stack applications.

After diving deep into the theory of React and Spring Boot, I decided it was essential to apply what I'd learned by creating an end-to-end application from scratch, thus solidifying my skills through real-world practice.

## 🎯 What Does the App Do?

The Task Manager App is designed to help you minimize procrastination by offering:

- **Structured Task Organization:** Clearly organize your tasks, categorize them, and filter according to priority or status.
- **Pomodoro Technique Integration:** Helps you efficiently complete tasks by structuring work sessions into focused intervals separated by short breaks, leveraging the well-known Pomodoro productivity method.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **React:** Chosen for its popularity, ease of use, and efficient rendering capabilities.
- **Spring Boot:** Selected due to its widespread adoption and significance in industry-standard backend development.

## 🧩 Challenges Faced

- **Structuring Application Logic:** Developing intuitive features is straightforward in theory, but conceptualizing and structuring the underlying application logic from scratch posed significant challenges and great learning opportunities.

## ⚙️ Installation & Running the Project

### Step-by-step guide:

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Alae-J/Toki
    ```

2. **Run Frontend**
    ```bash
    cd frontend/
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

3. **Run Backend**
    Open a new terminal and execute:
    ```bash
    cd backend/
    mvn clean spring-boot:run
    ```

Now, your Task Manager App should be up and running!
